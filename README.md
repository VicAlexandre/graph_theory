## 🛠 Graph Library

The library provides a comprehensive set of functionalities to:

- Create and manipulate directed and undirected graphs
- Perform basic graph traversals
- Apply graph algorithms

This library implements graphs through adjacency lists, providing efficient operations.

## 💽 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VicAlexandre/graph_theory.git
```

2. Navigate and compile:

```bash
cd graph_theory
make
```

This will automatically compile both the library and the driver test code.

## 📝 Usage

To use the library in your project, include the necessary header files and link against the provided static library. As for the implementations, currently only a 'test.c' file is available for testing the library, which is still pretty basic and will be further expanded.

## 👥 Contribution

Contributions to any code here are more than welcome, since it's only the beginning of the project!

Note: This project is a work-in-progress. Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are highly appreciated.
